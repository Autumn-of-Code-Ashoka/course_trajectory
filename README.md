# Course Trajectory Mapper


The Course Trajectory Mapper is a web application that allows users to plan and track their academic progress by mapping out their course trajectory over multiple semesters. Users can easily visualize the courses they have taken, the credits completed for their major and minor, and the number of credits remaining to fulfill their degree requirements.


## Features

- Drag and drop functionality: Users can easily drag and drop the courses they have taken over the last few semesters onto the mapper interface.
- Credit tracking: The mapper automatically calculates and displays the credits completed for the user's major and minor, as well as the number of credits left to take.
- Semester planning: Users can also drag and drop courses they wish to take in future semesters, allowing them to plan their entire course trajectory over a span of six semesters.
- Course search and filtering: Users can search and filter courses based on subject, making it easier to find specific courses of interest.
- Cross-listed courses: In cases where courses are cross-listed, users can choose whether they want the course credits to count towards their major or minor using a toggle next to the course name.
